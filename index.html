            <h1>Welcome to the Jokeaboom Zone</h1>
            <p>This website exists to help you with the Lampoon literature comp. Below are a series of definitions and suggestions to guide you in the right direction. Also included are examples of pieces written by Lampoon staff members which would not all be suitable for the comp but offer excellent examples of writing. These pieces should serve as a source of inspiration rather than a source of plagiarism, unless of course you change the font.</p>
            <p><strong>Glossary</strong></p>
            <p>Here is a series of terms you may hear us yell during office hours. As a rule of thumb, the louder we say something, the more important it is.</p>
            <p><em>Subversion</em> - A type of joke that takes the reader’s expectation and turns it on its head; something that is funny simply because it’s not what you expect.</p>
            <p><em>Premise</em> - The main idea of the piece. Generally relates to a specific situation/set of characters/series of events.</p>
            <p><em>AH! FIRE!</em> - A staff member’s cigarette has set the library alight. Please proceed calmly to the nearest emergency exit.</p>
            <p><em>Dialogue Piece</em> - A piece that is a transcript of two or more people talking.</p>
            <p><em>Prose Piece</em> - Paragraph-style piece. Often, but not always, written in the first or third person.</p>
            <p><em>List Piece</em> - A list of words, sentences, or paragraphs rested on a premise.</p>
            <p><em>Vignette Piece</em> - Several different chunks of prose or dialogue. Each chunk can take place in a different setting with completely different characters, but there is usually some connecting feature between them all.</p>
            <p><em>Flimflammer</em> - Not too sure about this one. A bird? Some kind of vehicle?</p>
            <p><em>Magazine</em> - A two-dimensional projection of the joke realm onto our universe.</p>
            <p><em>High/Low Humor</em> - Jokes formed by taking something from high culture (man in top hat) and mixing it with low culture (man relieving himself into a tophat). Easy joke structure, try to avoid.</p>
            <p><em>Rule of Threes</em> - Listing two normal things and making the third one odd, abnormal, or HORSEY TIME. An often used joke structure, try to avoid.</p>
            <p><em>Hahahaha </em>- I am laughing.</p>
            <p><em>Haha</em> - I am laughing, but not as hard.</p>
            <p><em>Grrrrrrrr</em> - You are showing your piece to an angry dog. It has a weak grasp of written comedy and is taking out its frustrations on you.</p>
            <p><em>Shock Humor </em>- Using violence, profanity, or vulgarity to get a cheap laugh. Avoid.</p>
            <p><em>Joke Flag</em> - The use of exclamation point, caps lock, italics, underline, parentheses, or other joke formatting to draw attention or ‘flag’ a joke. Your jokes should be good enough that they don’t need to be pointed out. ‘AVOID.’</p>
            <p><em>Arguing With Your Comp Director About Why Your Piece Actually is Good and We Just Don’t Get It </em>- A productive use of your time and something we, as comp directors, particularly enjoy.</p>
            <p><em>Joke Density</em> - Higher is better.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>Things to generally avoid</strong></p>
            <p><em>Harvard-specific humor - </em>Our magazine is read exclusively by members of the Harvard administrative board and they send us angry handwritten letters when we make jokes about them.</p>
            <p><em>Recent pop culture references</em> - We want the magazine to be relevant forever.</p>
            <p><em>Recent political satire - </em>We want the magazine to be relevant forever.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>But remember: rules are made to be broken. There are successful exceptions to all of these guidelines. We’re more interested in seeing funny writing than in seeing writing that conforms to these definitions. All a good piece needs to succeed in the comp is good street smarts.</p>
